# Rhythm
Current version: 0.9

Rhythm is a small library for Android that draws grids and guides over views, making it easier to fine tune your layouts according to the [principles][1] of nice, balanced, _rhythmic_ design.
If you are passionate about carefully crafted beautiful layouts and aspiring to #BuildBetterApps, take Rhythm into your toolchain.

Key features:

* Superior flexibility.
  Highly customizable grids and guides, possibility to create custom layers, and more!
  Make as many patterns, and assign them to as many views as you need.
* Easy and effortless.
  Define the patterns once and control everything via the Quick Control notification¹ without ever leaving your current screen. No need to rebuild too!
* Adaptable.
  Don’t feel like wrapping your views in another `FrameLayout`? Rhythm overlays are Drawables, which you can explicitly use however you like. Rhythm can even decorate the views for you, in a single line of code.
* Suitable for dialogs and scrolling content.
* Built with performance in mind.
* API 8+¹.
* Crafted by a design-minded developer, for design-minded developers.
* Open source, open for forks, pull requests, and suggestions².

## Installation


---
¹ — Controlling overlays on the go is only available for Android 4.1 and above, since it relies on action buttons in the notification. This will be addressed in version 1.0.
² — Especially looking for ideas on how to exclude or at least minimize the impact of this library on production builds.
