    <string name="copy_1">This app demonstrates the capabilities of the&#160;library and how it can be&#160;used in a real&#160;project.
       You are welcome to examine its source&#160;code on&#160;<a href="https://github.com/Actinarium/Rhythm/tree/master/sample">GitHub</a>.</string>

    <string name="card_header">Details matter</string>
    <string name="card_text">Do you agree with this white and purple marshmallow?</string>
    <string name="agree">Agree</string>
    <string name="agree_msg">That’s the spirit!</string>

    <string name="copy_2">Open the Notification drawer to access Rhythm Quick Control, which allows&#160;you to cycle through configurations without leaving your current&#160;screen.
        Go ahead and play&#160;around with overlays for different provided&#160;groups.</string>

    <string name="copy_3">As of v0.9, Rhythm allows you to mix and match these <i>spec layer</i> types to make various overlays:</string>
    <string-array name="bullet_points">
        <item>Horizontal and vertical grid lines, repeating at a fixed step, with optional offset and margins.
            Add two grid line layers to make a grid.\n</item>
        <item>Guides of arbitrary color and thickness, to make keylines and highlights.\n</item>
        <item>Dimensions label, to inspect view’s dimensions at glance.\n</item>
        <item>More spec layer types coming soon; meanwhile you can create custom ones.</item>
