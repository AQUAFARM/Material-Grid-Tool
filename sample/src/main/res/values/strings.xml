    <string name="app_title">Rhythm sample app</string>

    <string name="sample_header">Hello there!</string>
    <string name="copy_1">This here is a sample app to show off my Rhythm library and inspire you to use it.
        It’s a small library that allows you to define custom overlays (grids, keylines, and more) and draw them over your views,
        therefore helping you to build pixel-perfect Material Design layouts.</string>
    <string name="copy_2">After playing around with the sample check out its <a href="https://github.com/Actinarium/Rhythm/tree/master/sample">source code</a> for complete experience.</string>
    <string name="copy_3"><b>Hey!</b> Since you’re already judging, please report if you notice something <i>out of rhythm</i> (i.e. not aligned to 8dp/4dp grid) in this sample, will you?</string>

    <string name="card_header">Intermission</string>
    <string name="card_text">Take a moment to appreciate this beautifully laid out card.</string>
    <string name="toggle">Toggle overlay</string>

    <string name="copy_4">Pull down the notification shade to find Rhythm Quick Control. You can switch overlays for registered groups at runtime.
        Try this now, change overlay for every group, and see if you can find layout bounds.</string>

    <string name="copy_5">Rhythm 0.9.5 introduces <b>declarative config</b>, making building overlays a breeze.
        Examine the <font face="monospace">/res/raw/overlay_config</font>, or try it out right here!</string>
